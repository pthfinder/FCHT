# Changes the education focus of any AI who has a martial focus and shouldnt.
# This is a big problem at the start of the game where practically every female with the
# bossy trait has a martial focus. It's totally ahistorical and even nonsensical that
# someone who isn't even allowed to fight in battles wouild have a martial upbringing.
# Now this applies to men as well, if the religion is femaled dominated, I just use women
# as an example because I'm pretty sure 99.9% of religions in this are male dominated at
# the start.
